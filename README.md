# DARTA - A Trustless, Permissionless Biomarker Data Marketplace

DARTA is a web3 project that aims to build a marketplace for data related to biomarkers, laboratory test result. It is designed to be trustless and permissionless, allowing anyone to contribute data and organizations to access it for research or AI model training.

DARTA has a two-layer mechanism for ensuring the quality and value of the data on the platform. The first layer is a social credit system, which records the credentials of data providers and helps to establish their trustworthiness. The second layer is a data appraisal system, which uses various statistical metrics to provide insights on the value of the data.

By contributing data to DARTA, you can earn economic incentives and contribute to research progress. Organizations can use the platform to access high-quality data and advance their research efforts.

We welcome contributions and feedback from the community. If you are interested in collaborating or have ideas for improving DARTA, please don't hesitate to reach out.
